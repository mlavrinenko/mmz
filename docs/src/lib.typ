// docs/src/lib.typ — shared helpers for the docs/src/*.typ sources that
// docs/generate-md.sh renders to Markdown with typlite (nixpkgs' tinymist,
// `$out/bin/typlite`; see flake.nix for the pin). This module is NOT itself a
// source: it carries no `<mmz-md>` metadata block, so the generator's glob
// (docs/src/**/*.typ) skips it via the same zero-match check it uses for any
// future non-source helper under docs/src/.
//
// A docs/src source is a SEPARATE render path from the www/content/*.typ docs
// site pages: those open with `#show: page.with(...)` and target HTML — neither
// typlite understands, and typlite errors on the `set document(...)` a `page`
// show rule issues. A docs/src source is plain Typst with no page show rule, so
// typlite can walk it on its own.
//
// Being a separate render path is also why a cross-link INTO the docs site is
// the one thing a source must never hand-type. Nothing in this repo resolves an
// absolute URL sitting in generated Markdown, so a renamed page ships a 404
// that only a reader ever finds. `www-link` / `www-title` / `www-summary` below
// read the route out of the generated page manifest instead, and fail the
// render naming it when it is not there.
//
// Constraints typlite imposes on every source below, verified against the
// pinned tinymist / typst 0.14.2:
//
//   - `=`/`==` headings shift DOWN one level (`##`/`###`) — there is no way
//     back to a bare `#`: `set heading(offset: -1)` errors "number must be at
//     least zero". `doc-title` below is the one working path to `#`.
//   - `set document(...)` errors — typlite wraps the input in its own container.
//   - `#footnote[...]` is a HARD ERROR inside typlite's own `md-link`. Footnotes
//     are unusable here.
//   - `#html.elem("p"/"div"/"span")` is SILENTLY STRIPPED, attributes included —
//     nothing appears in the output and nothing errors. `h1`..`h6`, `img`, `br`,
//     `center`, `blockquote` ARE preserved as literal HTML tags.
//   - `#link("a/b.md")[x]` becomes `[x](a/b.md)`, or a raw `<a href="...">` when
//     nested inside an `html.elem`.
//   - `json(...)` and `raw(read(...))` both work — a source can read
//     `www/generated/*.json` (see `fact` below) or another file's bytes.
//   - `#metadata(v) <label>` emits nothing into the rendered Markdown;
//     `typst query` reads it back out of the source. This is how the `<mmz-md>`
//     block every source carries works.
//   - `\@foo` renders as the literal text `@foo`; an unescaped `@foo` risks
//     being read as a citation, so escape defensively.
//   - `->` renders escaped, as `-\>`; prefer backticks or `→` instead.
//   - `"straight quotes"` outside a raw/code span render as smart quotes.
//   - Tables, ordered/nested lists, fenced code, blockquotes, definition lists,
//     `*bold*` and `_em_` all round-trip clean.
//   - A backtick raw span must not be BROKEN ACROSS A SOURCE LINE. Typst keeps
//     the newline inside the span, and typlite emits it literally into the
//     Markdown — inside a table row that ends the row mid-cell and corrupts the
//     table. Hard-wrap the prose around a code span, never through one.
//   - A `;` — and any other character Typst can read as continuing a code
//     expression — glued straight onto a `#link(...)[...]`'s closing `]` with no
//     space is SWALLOWED. Put a space before it.
//   - A source line that OPENS with a number and a period — `5. A rule …`, the
//     shape a hard-wrapped sentence lands in by accident — is an enum item to
//     Typst, not prose. The paragraph splits and the Markdown grows a stray list
//     marker; nothing errors. Rewrap, or escape the period: `5\.`.
//   - A raw/code span containing a literal backtick does NOT get a wider
//     Markdown delimiter — typlite always wraps in a SINGLE backtick regardless
//     of content, so the emitted span is broken CommonMark. Never put a literal
//     backtick inside a raw span; rephrase around it.
//
// One consequence worth stating plainly, because it is why the freshness gate
// and the linecop caps land where they do: typlite emits ONE LINE PER PARAGRAPH
// — it does not hard-wrap. A generated .md's line count is thus not a meaningful
// size proxy; .linecop.yaml caps the .typ SOURCE only and excludes every path a
// source declares as its `output`.

// The one `#` (ATX h1) a document needs. typlite maps `=`/`==` down a level and
// has no working `offset: -1` escape hatch (see above), so the document title
// goes through the one HTML element typlite preserves verbatim at any position
// instead of through Typst's own heading syntax.
#let doc-title(body) = html.elem("h1")[#body]

// Spell a small derived count as an English word, so prose that used to read
// "Two gates" does not regress to "2 gates" the moment the number stops being
// hand-typed. Above a table, fall back to the numeral — that is where a numeral
// is what a reader wants anyway.
